Three underlying datasets (merged on bureaucratic indicators and countries) cover the overall aspect of understanding jobs and salary information for almost all countries. Some other variables and indicators provide various public policy information that could help bureaucrats and government policymakers study and improve the current situation in their respective countries. I have downloaded the data from the required source and performed initial cleaning steps to get a well-defined data version for research needs. I took a few initial analytics steps, such as joining two datasets to gather information on specific indicators to help understand and develop project-related questions. \nThe steps to download the required datasets and load them in data/2024/2024-04-30 location can be found below:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-04-30')\n\n\n    Downloading file 1 of 3: `wwbi_data.csv`\n    Downloading file 2 of 3: `wwbi_series.csv`\n    Downloading file 3 of 3: `wwbi_country.csv`\n\nwwbi_data &lt;- tuesdata$wwbi_data\nwwbi_series &lt;- tuesdata$wwbi_series\nwwbi_country &lt;- tuesdata$wwbi_country\n\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-04-30')\n\n\n    Downloading file 1 of 3: `wwbi_data.csv`\n    Downloading file 2 of 3: `wwbi_series.csv`\n    Downloading file 3 of 3: `wwbi_country.csv`\n\nwwbi_data &lt;- tuesdata$wwbi_data\nwwbi_series &lt;- tuesdata$wwbi_series\nwwbi_country &lt;- tuesdata$wwbi_country\n\n\n# Clean the data downloaded from the WWBI website and \n# load the three csv files into data folder \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(fs)\nlibrary(withr)\n\nworking_dir &lt;- here::here(\"data\", \"2024\", \"2024-04-30\")\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/WWBI_CSV.zip\"\n\nfile_path &lt;- withr::local_tempfile(fileext = \".zip\")\ndownload.file(url, file_path)\n\nextract_dir &lt;- withr::local_tempdir(\"csvs\")\nunzip(file_path, exdir = extract_dir)\n\nwwbi_country &lt;- readr::read_csv(\n  fs::path(extract_dir, \"WWBICountry.csv\")\n) |&gt; \n  janitor::clean_names() |&gt; \n  janitor::remove_empty(\"cols\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    # Several columns are years, make them integers\n    national_accounts_reference_year = as.integer(national_accounts_reference_year),\n    latest_industrial_data = as.integer(latest_industrial_data),\n    latest_trade_data = as.integer(latest_trade_data),\n    latest_population_census_year = as.integer(stringr::str_extract(\n      latest_population_census,\n      \"^\\\\d{4}\"\n    )),\n    latest_agricultural_census = as.integer(stringr::str_extract(\n      latest_agricultural_census,\n      \"^\\\\d{4}\"\n    )),\n    national_accounts_base_year = as.integer(stringr::str_extract(\n      national_accounts_base_year,\n      \"^\\\\d{4}\"\n    )),\n    system_of_national_accounts = as.integer(stringr::str_extract(\n      system_of_national_accounts,\n      \"\\\\d{4}\"\n    )),\n    latest_population_census_notes = stringr::str_remove(\n      latest_population_census,\n      \"^\\\\d{4}\\\\.?\\\\s*\"\n    ),\n    latest_population_census_notes = dplyr::na_if(\n      latest_population_census_notes,\n      \"\"\n    ),\n    # vital_registration_complete is either \"yes\" or \"NA\"\n    vital_registration_complete = !is.na(vital_registration_complete) \n  ) |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(-\"latest_population_census\")\n\nwwbi_series &lt;- readr::read_csv(\n  fs::path(extract_dir, \"WWBISeries.csv\"),\n  col_types = paste(rep(\"c\", 21), collapse = \"\")\n) |&gt; \n  janitor::clean_names() |&gt; \n  janitor::remove_empty(\"cols\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::rename(indicator_code = \"series_code\")\n\nwwbi_data &lt;- readr::read_csv(\n  fs::path(extract_dir, \"WWBIData.csv\"),\n  col_types = paste(c(rep(\"c\", 4), rep(\"d\", 21), \"c\"), collapse = \"\")\n) |&gt; \n  janitor::clean_names() |&gt; \n  # indicator_name and country_name are redundant.\n  dplyr::select(-\"indicator_name\", -\"country_name\") |&gt; \n  janitor::remove_empty(\"cols\") |&gt; \n  tidyr::pivot_longer(\n    cols = -c(country_code, indicator_code),\n    names_to = \"year\",\n    names_transform = ~ as.integer(stringr::str_remove(.x, \"x\")),\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(value))\n\nreadr::write_csv(\n  wwbi_data,\n  fs::path(working_dir, \"wwbi_data.csv\")\n)\nreadr::write_csv(\n  wwbi_series,\n  fs::path(working_dir, \"wwbi_series.csv\")\n)\nreadr::write_csv(\n  wwbi_country,\n  fs::path(working_dir, \"wwbi_country.csv\")\n)\n\nThe reason why I chose this dataset:\nI am interested in understanding and researching data that could help gain insights into current scenarios of public policies and their actual on-ground implementation, understand the trends across geographies, and take lessons on how to improve or suggest improvements in country-specific needs and situations. I believe the analytics and visualizations created as part of the final project will help me understand and convey to a larger audience the correct and expected implementations of public policies."

    "section": "Questions",
    "text": "Questions\nThe two questions I want to answer:\nResearch the variables and investigate if they can be applied or accepted uniformly across countries or if they will portray different pictures, i.e., convey dissimilar messages based on the underlying survey data. For example, the latest agricultural census data varies for every country. Not all have performed the census recently, so merging the analysis and concluding something specific for each would be difficult. Similarly, the four blog posts mentioned on the webpage only cover topics on jobs and gender participation but miss the point on other indicators valuable in understanding the importance of other indicator priorities."
